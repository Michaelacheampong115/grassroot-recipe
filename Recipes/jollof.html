<h3>Steps in Coooking Jollof Rice.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for <br> about 45 seconds,
         make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
    <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. 
        Once the oil is heated add the onions<br> you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. 
        Once the onions, have turned brown in color add <br> the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. 
        Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) <br> and fry the mixture  with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes.
         Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
    <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. 
        Mix and add your seasonings <br> (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock <br> cube). 
        Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. 
        At this point if you need to add water so that the <br> rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken <br> stock go 
        ahead and do so. 
        Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
    <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, <br>
        and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. 
        Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, <br> and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
