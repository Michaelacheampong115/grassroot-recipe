            <h3>Steps in Cooking Banku and Okro Stew</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl,
                     mix Cassava dough with moderate water and strain out the lumps using colander into pot or saucepan</li>
                <li>After straining into pot, add corn dough, add extra water and mix together using your hands <br> until smooth 
                    and 
                    slightly thick mixture is formed. Add salt to taste</li>
                <li>Under medium heat, place mixture on fire. Stir consistently until the mixture starts to boil.</li>
                <li>Once it begins boiling, use a spatula(Banku ‘ta’) to knead the mixture to prevent it from forming lumps.</li>
                <li>Continuously knead the mixture intermittently until it gets smoother <br> 
                    and thicker and its colour changes slightly for about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Banku is ready when you don’t taste the raw corn dough after eating <br> 
                    or you can mash a little of the cooked mixture in a little water.
                     If it dissolves and turns milky then your <br> Banku isn’t ready. </li>
                <li>When the Banku is ready, scoop it out and wrap each ball in a plain polythene rubber.</li>
